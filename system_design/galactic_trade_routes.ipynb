    "# Galactic trade routes\n",
    "You are the supreme ruler of the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to establish trade routes between your planets, to make your empire more prosperous.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an organized ruler, you have listed all your planets, their 3D coordinates, and their type. You identified two types: planets producing mainly food and needing metal, and planets producing mostly metal and needing food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every food planet should have a trade route with at least one metal planet, and every metal planet should have a trade route with at least one food planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goods cannot transit on another planet after they arrive at their first destination. So obviously, connecting two planets of the same type is useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "A planet can exchange goods with multiple other planets. Multiple planet clusters, isolated from one another, can exist if every planet has a trade route to a complementary planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you compute the trade routes to establish so that the sum of the distances is the lowest possible?"
