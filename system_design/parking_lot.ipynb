    "## Goals: Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few methods that you should be able to run:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tell us how many spots are remaining\n",
    "- Tell us how many total spots are in the parking lot\n",
    "- Tell us when the parking lot is full\n",
    "- Tell us when the parking lot is empty\n",
    "- Tell us when certain spots are full e.g. when all motorcycle spots are taken\n",
    "- Tell us how many spots vans are taking up\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars and vans\n",
    "- The parking lot has motorcycle spots, car spots and large spots\n",
    "- A motorcycle can park in any spot\n",
    "- A car can park in a regular or large spot\n",
    "- A van can park in a large spot, but it will take up 3 regular spots"
